# Online-Course-Bot

A [Slack](https://slack.com) Bot that uses [slash commands]() to get quick summary of topics from wikipedia.


## `Current status`
* Responds to 1 slash command - “/define”. The result includes a definition of the queried term and any udacity forum posts (from **Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge Scholarship Course**) related to the queried term.

## `Future scope and ideas`
* Integrate results from Airtable (either as a separate query or together with /define query or both)

* Integrate scholar_resources (if any scholar has written a blog, video or anything during the course) and return them in the query result (again separate query or integrated or both).

* Add data analysis - which topics are questioned the most, which subject (statistics, python or sql) is questioned the most etc.

* Open to ideas (add in issues).


## `Benefit to the community`
* Those who have no experience with such stuff can learn from the project (flask app development, heroku deployment, slack bot, database, github, web scraping, etc).

* The project uses Python and SQL - both taught in the course [*Bertelsmann Data Science Challenge Scholarship Course*]. We can apply the knowledge here. Can integrate Statistics (through data analysis) as well.
